## Session 5: Feature Implementation Agent
Date: 2025-01-09

### Features Implemented This Session
Progress: 185/189 → 187/189 (97.9% → 98.9%)

#### Features Fixed:
- ✅ Feature 69: State persists during session
- ✅ Feature 160: Session state survives navigation

### Implementation Details

#### Session State Persistence
The previous sessions noted that state didn't persist when navigating away from and back to the editor. This was because state was managed locally in the editor page component using `useState`.

**Solution implemented:**
1. Created `lib/EditorContext.tsx` - A React Context to hold global state:
   - `currentPage` - Current page being viewed
   - `uploadedImages` - Array of uploaded images in the tray
   - `imagesBySlot` - Map of slot IDs to placed images
   - Helper functions: `addUploadedImages`, `handleDrop`, `setCurrentPage`, `resetState`

2. Created `components/Providers.tsx` - Client component wrapper for the context provider

3. Updated `app/layout.tsx` - Wrapped the app with the Providers component

4. Updated `app/photobooks/editor/page.tsx` - Switched from local `useState` to `useEditor()` context hook

**Result:** State now persists during the browser session when navigating away from and back to the editor, but resets on page refresh (as intended by MVP spec).

### Remaining Features (2)
- Feature 172: Application works in Firefox - Cannot test (Playwright uses Chromium)
- Feature 173: Application works in Safari - Cannot test (Playwright uses Chromium)

These require cross-browser testing which is not possible with the current Playwright configuration.

### Regression Testing Performed
- ✅ Full user flow: Landing → Album Selection → Album Detail → Editor
- ✅ Upload two images to tray
- ✅ Place images in slots on Page 1 and Page 2
- ✅ Navigate away to /photobooks/album-1 → /photobooks
- ✅ Navigate back to editor - all state preserved
- ✅ No console errors

### Final Statistics
- **Total Features:** 189
- **Passing:** 187 (98.9%)
- **Cannot Pass:** 2 (1.1%)
  - Both require cross-browser testing (Firefox/Safari)

### Git Commits This Session
- `625b5d7` - Add session state persistence via React Context

### Application Status
- ✅ Development server: Running on port 3000
- ✅ Production build: Passes
- ✅ Session state persistence: Working
- ✅ All testable functionality verified working
- ✅ Ready for deployment

### Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Check feature stats
# Use feature_get_stats tool
```

## Session 6: Verification Agent
Date: 2025-01-09

### Session Summary
This session performed comprehensive regression testing to verify all existing functionality still works correctly.

### Regression Testing Results
Full user flow tested end-to-end:
- ✅ Landing page renders with hero section and CTA button
- ✅ CTA navigates to /photobooks (album selection)
- ✅ Album selection shows 3 cards (Album 1 active, Album 2/3 "Coming Soon")
- ✅ Clicking Album 1 navigates to /photobooks/album-1
- ✅ Album detail page shows album info with "Start Editing" button
- ✅ Start Editing navigates to /photobooks/editor
- ✅ Editor shows upload tray (left sidebar) and page canvas (main area)
- ✅ Page 1 displays 7 slots correctly
- ✅ File upload works (uploaded 2 test images)
- ✅ Drag and drop from tray to slot places image (copy behavior)
- ✅ Page navigation works (switching to page 2 and back)
- ✅ State persists when switching pages
- ✅ Navigation persistence: Left editor → returned → state preserved (images in tray and slots)
- ✅ No console errors detected
- ✅ Screenshot captured: .playwright-mcp/final-state-editor.png

### Remaining Features (2)
Features 172 and 173 require cross-browser testing:
- Feature 172: Application works in Firefox
- Feature 173: Application works in Safari

**Blocker:** The Playwright MCP uses Chromium only and does not support browser switching. These features cannot be tested with the current tooling.

**Note:** The application uses standard web technologies (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, HTML5 drag-and-drop) with no browser-specific code. It should work correctly in Firefox and Safari, but this cannot be verified programmatically.

### Final Statistics
- **Total Features:** 189
- **Passing:** 187 (98.9%)
- **Cannot Test:** 2 (1.1%)
  - Feature 172: Firefox testing (external tooling limitation)
  - Feature 173: Safari testing (external tooling limitation)

### Application Status
- ✅ Development server: Running on port 3000
- ✅ All core functionality verified working
- ✅ Session state persistence working
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

### What the Next Agent Should Know
1. The application is complete and all testable features are passing
2. The 2 remaining features require cross-browser testing which cannot be done with Playwright MCP
3. No code changes needed - the app is production-ready
4. Consider manual browser testing in Firefox/Safari if cross-browser verification is critical

### Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Check feature stats
# Use feature_get_stats tool
```
